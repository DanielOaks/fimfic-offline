FIMFiction Offline Reader
=========================

In a nutshell, this web-app downloads all the stories in your FIMFiction Read Later list, and stores them locally.

They will all be accessable for reading on-the-go.

Currently, this does not function in most browsers due to the same-origin policy. In the future, I hope the admins and I can work out a way to allow this to work through that, though. So, for now, you need to use Chrome running with --web-security-disabled in order to access and use this.
